# A ResolutionProposal is a proposed resolution. In other words, it is not
# a resolution itself, but rather it is a suggested resolution.
# It is created when a Member of a Co-op wants to suggest a Resolution.
# The ResolutionProposal is 'passed' if the Directors/Secretary agree
# to open the suggested resolution to a vote. At that point, the
# 'real' Resolution is created.
