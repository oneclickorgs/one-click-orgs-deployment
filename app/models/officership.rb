# An Officership represents the period during which a particular
# person occupies a particular office.
#
# Each Office can only have one current Officership, but will have
# a history of many Officerships as different people occupy the
# Office.
#
# Similarly, a Member can only have one current Officership (i.e.
# they can only occupy one Office at a time). But they may build
# up a history of many Officerships if they occupy several Offices
# in sequence.
