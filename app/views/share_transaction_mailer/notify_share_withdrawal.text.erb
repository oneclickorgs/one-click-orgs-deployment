Dear <%=raw( @recipient.name || 'Secretary') %>,

<%=raw( @applicant.name ) %> has made a new application to withdraw <%=raw( pluralize(@share_transaction.amount, 'share.', 'shares.') )%>

The withdrawal will become due for payment on <%=raw( @share_transaction.withdrawal_due_date.to_s(:long) )%>.

Thanks,

<%=raw @organisation.name %>
