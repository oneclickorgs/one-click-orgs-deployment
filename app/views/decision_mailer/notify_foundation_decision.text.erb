In the vote to form <%=raw( @organisation_name )%> as an Association held between <%=raw( @proposal.creation_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') )%> on <%=raw( @proposal.creation_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') )%> and <%=raw( @proposal.close_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') )%> on <%=raw( @proposal.close_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') )%> <%=raw( @proposal.votes_for )%> people voted for and <%=raw( @proposal.votes_against )%> people voted against formation. 

<% if @proposal.passed? %>
The Association has therefore been formed with the following members: 
<% @members.each do |m| %>
<%=raw( m.name )%>
<% end %>

<% if @member_vote and @member_vote.for? %>

A minimum of three supporting votes is required to form an Association. You could consider modifying the Draft Constitution or inviting additional Founding Members. When everyone's ready you can try another Founding Vote.

<% if @member.invitation_code %>
<%=raw( short_invitation_url(:id => @member.invitation_code) )%>
<% else %>
<%=raw( @organisation.domain ) %>
<% end %>
<% end %>

Thanks

<%=raw @organisation_name%>
