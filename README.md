# One Click Orgs

One Click Orgs is a website where groups can quickly create a legal structure and get a simple system for group decisions. We think social enterprises, collectives and activist groups have better things to think about than obscure legal clauses.

The One Click Orgs platform gives you:

 * A constitution written in plain english
 * An official legal structure so your group can open a bank account
 * A list of group members that's automatically kept up to date
 * A voting system to help make group decisions
 * A record of every decision that's been made
 * Easy ways to modify the constitution as your group develops
