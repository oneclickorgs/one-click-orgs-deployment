    And a company has been added

    And I press "Propose a vote"
    And I fill in "Title" with "We should buy more tea"
    And I fill in "Description" with "So we can drink more tea."
    And I press "Create proposal"
    Then I should be on the proposal page
    And I should see "We should buy more tea"

    And everyone should receive an email notifying them of the proposal
