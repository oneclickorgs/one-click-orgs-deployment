Feature: Amending membership settings
  In order to make sure the co-op is handling membership in the best way
  As the Secretary
  I want to adjust settings to do with membership

  Scenario: Secretary amends the membership application form
    Given there is a co-op
    And I am the Secretary of the co-op
    When I go to the Members page
    And I press "Amend the membership application form"
    And I enter new text for the membership application form
    And I certify that the new text was agreed by the Directors
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then I should see "The membership application form has been amended."
