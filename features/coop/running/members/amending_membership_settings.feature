Feature: Amending membership settings
  In order to make sure the co-op is handling membership in the best way
  As the Secretary
  I want to adjust settings to do with membership

  # @wip
  # Scenario: Secretary amends the membership application form
  #   Given there is a co-op
  #   And I am the Secretary of the co-op
  #   When I go to the Members page
  #   And I press "Amend the membership application form"
  #   And I enter new text for the membership application form
  #   And I certify that the new text was agreed by the Directors
  #   And I press "Save changes"
  #   Then I should see "The membership application form has been amended."
