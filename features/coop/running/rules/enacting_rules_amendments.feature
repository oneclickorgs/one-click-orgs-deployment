Feature: Enacting Rules amendments
  In order to follow through on amendments to the Rules
  As the Secretary
  I want to see the results of resolutions amending the Rules

  Scenario: Resolution amends the Rules
    Given there is a co-op
    And I am the Secretary of the co-op
    And there is a passed resolution to change the organisation name to 'The Tea IPS'
    When the proposal closer runs
    And I go to the Rules page
    Then I should see "The Tea IPS"
