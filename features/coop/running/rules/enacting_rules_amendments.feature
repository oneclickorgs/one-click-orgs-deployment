Feature: Enacting Rules amendments
  In order to follow through on amendments to the Rules
  As the Secretary
  I want to see the results of resolutions amending the Rules

  # Scenario: Resolution amends the Rules
  #   Given there is a co-op
  #   And I am the Secretary of the co-op
  #   And there is a passed resolution to change the organisation name to 'The Tea IPS'
  #   When the proposal closer runs
  #   And I go to the Rules page
  #   Then I should see "The Tea IPS"
