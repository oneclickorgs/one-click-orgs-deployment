Feature: Suggesting rules amendments
  In order to change the way the co-op works
  As a Member
  I want to suggest resolutions that change the Rules of the Co-op

  # @wip
  # Scenario: Member suggests draft resolutions to amend the Rules
  #   Given there is a co-op
  #   And I am a Member of the co-op
  #   When I go to the Rules page
  #   And I press "Suggest amendments to the Rules"
  #   And I change the Name to "The Tea Co-op"
  #   And I change the Registered office address to "1 Main Street"
  #   And I change the Objects to "buy all the tea."
  #   And I choose to allow "User" members
  #   And I choose to allow "Employee" members
  #   And I choose to disallow "Supporter" members
  #   And I choose to disallow "Producer" members
  #   And I choose to disallow "Consumer" members
  #   And I choose that Members hold one share only
  #   And I enter "2" for each of the Board composition fields
  #   And I choose Common Ownership
  #   And I press "Suggest these amendments"
  #   Then I should be on the Resolutions page
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Change organisation name to 'The Tea Co-op'"
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Change registered office address to '1 Main Street'"
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Change objects to 'buy all the tea.'"
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Disallow Supporter Members."
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Disallow Producer Members."
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Disallow Consumer Members."
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Permit members to hold one share only."
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Allow a maximum of 2 User Members on the Board."
  #   And I should see a suggested resolution "Allow a maximum of 2 Employee Members on the Board"
