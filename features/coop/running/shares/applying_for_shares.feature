  Scenario: Member applies for more shares
    Given there is a co-op
    And members of the co-op can hold more than one share
    And I am a Member of the co-op
    When I go to the Shares page
    And I press "Apply for more shares"
    And I enter the number of additional shares I want
    Then I should see the payment that will be required
    When I press "Apply for more shares"
    Then I should see that a payment is required for my new shares
    And the Secretary should receive a notification of the new share application
