Feature: Managing share payments
  In order to respond to members' requests for new shares
  As the Secretary
  I want to process new share applications

  # @wip
  # Scenario: Secretary processes a new share application
  #   Given there is a co-op
  #   And members of the co-op can hold more than one share
  #   And I am the Secretary of the co-op
  #   And a member has made an application for more shares
  #   When I go to the Shares page
  #   Then I should see the share application
  #   When I press "Mark as paid, and allot shares"
  #   Then I should see that the member's new shares have been allotted
